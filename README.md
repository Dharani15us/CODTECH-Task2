# Project : Student Grade Tracker
### Overview of the Project:
   The goal of this Python program is to create a grade tracking system that allows users (teachers, students, or administrators) to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade in a meaningful way.
   The program will also categorize the result by providing additional information such as letter grades (A, B, C, etc.) or GPA, offering insights into the student's performance.

### Objective:
1.Input Grade Information:

Prompt the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments.
The program should allow the user to enter multiple grades for a student (e.g., a list of grades for assignments, quizzes, exams, etc.).
Ensure that the grades are valid numbers (e.g., between 0 and 100) and handle potential input errors.
Calculate Average Grade:

2.Calculate the average grade for the student based on the grades provided for each subject or assignment.
If there are multiple categories or assignments, compute the overall average and keep track of individual assignment grades as well.
Determine Letter Grade or GPA:

3.Based on the calculated average grade, determine the letter grade or GPA.
For letter grades, you can implement a common grading scale (e.g., 90–100 is "A", 80–89 is "B", etc.).
For GPA, convert the average grade to a GPA on a standard scale (e.g., 4.0 scale, where an "A" is 4.0, "B" is 3.0, etc.).
Display Results:

4.Output the average grade, letter grade, and GPA (if applicable) in a clear and readable format.
Provide any additional feedback such as recommendations or warnings (e.g., if a student is at risk of failing).
